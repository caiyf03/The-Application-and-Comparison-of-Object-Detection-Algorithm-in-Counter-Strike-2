In recent years, real-time object detection has garnered significant attention due to
its wide range of applications, including in the gaming industry. This paper imple-
ments three algorithms, YOLOv7, SSD, and Faster R-CNN for real-time object
detection in the game Counter Strike 2. Due to the innovation of the application,
we first independently created the dataset of CSGO. Then, by combining these
algorithms, our proposed approach aims to achieve superior performance in detect-
ing various objects in real-time game play. We conducted extensive experiments to
compare the accuracy, speed, and overall performance. We innovatively proposed
numerous applications, for example, by real-time target distance calculation we
realize auto-aiming and for better accuracy, we combine the three output results,
using K-means,voting, and confidence to finally generate a better prediction.
